In this chapter we will learn the Extended Kalman filter (EKF). The EKF handles nonlinearity by linearizing the system at the point of the current estimate, and then the linear Kalman filter is used to filter this linearized system. It was one of the very first techniques used for nonlinear problems, and it remains the most common technique. \n",

    "The Kalman filter uses linear equations, so it does not work with nonlinear problems. Problems can be nonlinear in two ways. First, the process model might be nonlinear. An object falling through the atmosphere encounters drag which reduces its acceleration. The drag coefficient varies based on the velocity the object. The resulting behavior is nonlinear - it cannot be modeled with linear equations. Second, the measurements could be nonlinear. For example, a radar gives a range and bearing to a target. We use trigonometry, which is nonlinear, to compute the position of the target.\n",

In earlier chapters I built your intuition and minimized the math by using problems describable with Newton's equations. We know how to design $\\mathbf F$ based on high school physics.\n",

So this will not work.\n",

    "I said that this was a real problem, and in some ways it is. I've seen alternative presentations that used robot motion models that led to simpler Jacobians. On the other hand, my model of the movement is also simplistic in several ways. First, it uses a bicycle model. A real car has two sets of tires, and each travels on a different radius. The wheels do not grip the surface perfectly. I also assumed that the robot responds instantaneously to the control input. Sebastian Thrun writes in *Probabilistic Robots* that this simplified model is justified because the filters perform well when used to track real vehicles. The lesson here is that while you have to have a reasonably accurate nonlinear model, it does not need to be perfect to operate well. As a designer you will need to balance the fidelity of your model with the difficulty of the math and the CPU time required to perform the linear algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way in which this problem was simplistic is that we assumed that we knew the correspondance between the landmarks and measurements. But suppose we are using radar - how would we know that a specific signal return corresponded to a specific building in the local scene? This question hints at SLAM algorithms - simultaneous localization and mapping. SLAM is not the point of this book, so I will not elaborate on this topic. "

    "## UKF vs EKF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last chapter I used the UKF to solve this problem. The difference in implementation should be very clear. Computing the Jacobians for the state and measurement models was not trivial despite a rudimentary motion model. A different problem could result in a Jacobian which is difficult or impossible to derive analytically. In contrast, the UKF only requires you to provide a function that computes the system motion model and another for the measurement model. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many cases where the Jacobian cannot be found analytically. The details are beyond the scope of this book, but you will have to use numerical methods to compute the Jacobian. That undertaking is not trivial, and you will spend a significant portion of a master's degree at a STEM school learning techniques to handle such situations. Even then you'll likely only be able to solve problems related to your field - an aeronautical engineer learns a lot about Navier Stokes equations, but not much about modelling chemical reaction rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, UKFs are easy. Are they accurate? In practice they often perform better than the EKF. You can find plenty of research papers that prove that the UKF outperforms the EKF in various problem domains. It's not hard to understand why this would be true. The EKF works by linearizing the system model and measurement model at a single point, and the UKF uses $2n+1$ points.\n",

    "Here we can see that the computation of the UKF's mean is accurate to 2 decimal places. The standard deviation is slightly off, but you can also fine tune how the UKF computes the distribution by using the $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ parameters for generating the sigma points. Here I used $\\alpha=0.001$, $\\beta=3$, and $\\gamma=1$. Feel free to modify them to see the result. You should be able to get better results than I did. However, avoid over-tuning the UKF for a specific test. It may perform better for your test case, but worse in general."
